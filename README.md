# Therapy

A simple, light colour scheme making heavy use of background colours to highlight text.

_Note: Still very much a work-in-progress._

## Application Support

- Vim
- X Window
- GNU ls

## Installation

This repo doubles up as a Vim plugin, so you can install the Vim theme in the usual way you would install a plugin. For example, with [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```
Plug 'adamransom/therapy'
```

Then you can set it as your colorscheme in Vi with:

```Vimscript
colorscheme therapy
```
